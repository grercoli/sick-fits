#Prisma actually uses this thing called GraphQL Import, so I can import for example the Item type which Im returnting in Mutation. This is done by putting a comment
#It's gonna import all of the types and all the inputs from prisma.graphql, if it's not used in our schema it's not going to be imported
#So in mutation I can return an Item without having the type of item defined in this public facing API

# import * from './generated/prisma.graphql'

# type Dog {
#     name: String!
# }

type Mutation {
    # createDog(name: String!): Dog
    createItem(title: String, description: String, price: Int, image: String, largeImage: String): Item!
}

type Query {
    #dogs: [Dog]!
    items: [Item]! # items gonna return an array of item
}
